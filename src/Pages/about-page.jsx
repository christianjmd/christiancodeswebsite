        <h2>🍔 Places to eat in Melbourne</h2>
        <p>I think Melbourne has such amazing places to eat and drink. I understand why we have so many visitors! I love eating at steak places, asian fusion 
            restaurants, and our cafés (obviously). If you have any places you'd like to recommend,  <a href="/contact-page">hit me up</a>. 
        </p>
        <h2>🎧 Music!!!</h2>
        <p>I quite pride myself on how great I curate my music. I listen to anything from bedroom pop to hip-hop/RnB. 
            You can visit my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/25r217p4slls30cgny5pz5iu9?si=256c21b79442441d">Spotify</a> to see if we have similar taste!

            My girlfriend and I do share one account since she doesn't want to get one for herself.

            Favourite song right now: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-EHa2Mwt44&ab_channel=DanielCaesar">Violet</a> by Daniel Caesar.

        <h2>🇯🇵 Anything Japan</h2>
        <p>
            From their beautiful architecture to their anime, I love everything about Japan with all my heart. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I'll be visiting there this coming March (2023) and will be going to Tokyo and Kyoto (maybe a day trip to Osaka and Nara) for two weeks!

        <h2>🏀 Basketball</h2>
        <p>
            Don't come at me but my team is Golden State. Don't judge! I just happen to get into basketball the same time they began their dynasty and 
            it's so hard not to root for Steph.
